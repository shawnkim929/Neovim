## MY CONFIGURATION

Relatively minimal configuration that will eventually be updated and upgraded as time goes on.

### LIST OF PLUGINS

| Name | Notes |
--- | ---
Treesitter | Treesitter allows me to have nice syntax highlighting for the editor. I basically only use this because it let's me use the TS language servers that can highlight syntax, I don't give a shit about the other stuff
Feline | Makes my statusline and shit look pretty
OneDark | I don't know why I have this
Rose-pine | One of the themes I used to use, might be deleted soon because I no longer use it
vimtex | Used for writing notes, it's still not working for my current configuration but will eventually work soon when I finally get time to do anything
nvim-lspconfig | Lowkey forgot why I have this
