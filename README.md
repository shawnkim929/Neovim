## MY CONFIGURATION

Relatively minimal configuration that will eventually be updated and upgraded as time goes on.

This is my current configuration for Neovim using lua. Originally a pika-vim user for the past few years I've been looking for a Neovim configuration to figure out that my needs are probably best suited making my own configuration. I've also found a growing need to write more math notes and research papers throughout my undergraduate years at UCLA and uses my configuration for LaTeX.
